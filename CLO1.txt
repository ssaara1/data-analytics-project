It enables students to perform data analysis using Python programming. Students should select their dataset from a free source and conduct a methodical data analysis using Machine Learning algorithms. The project's primary objectives are:*  Generate a data summary using descriptive analysis*  Create a sample and visualize sample data using graphs/charts and remove the unwanted outliers; * Investigate the correlation between the variables; * Perform hypothesis testing if you have any assumptions about your dataset; * Perform data preprocessing prior to building a data model;* Create and optimize the regression model for the selected dataset in order to predict the values; and* Develop and Optimize the classification model for the selected dataset in order to predict the values.* Analyze the data for patterns or groups based on clustering and optimize the model in order to obtain the desired output.Project DescriptionYou are assigned to work on the data analysis for chosen dataset. The list of datasets is available in a Kaggle data source(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). The project carries 25% of your coursework marks. You are required to work in a team of maximum FOUR (4) members. It is important that you need to collaborate in working on the project within your team. The collaboration between the team members will be recorded, tracked, and monitored.For CLO1, CLO2, and CLO3 – Regression same dataset should be usedIf required, then CLO3 – classification and Cluster different dataset can be used.Project Tasks/QuestionsCLODeliverable Learning OutcomesMarks11. Define the purpose of data analysis for the chosen datasetThe goal of data analysis in this project is to better understand the performance of students based on their scores, gender, level of education, and other related factors. Through the analyzing of the data, we are able to observe patterns, trends, and relationships that provide us on how different factors impact the achievements of students. Such information can help us predict future scores, and track students who would need special help, and improve educational planning.22. Identify and Justify the type of programming used for data analysis.Python programming language was used in this project. Python is best for data analysis as it is simple to learn and has important libraries like:1-Pandas: to organize and explore data.2-Seaborn and Matplotlib: to create colorful and neat graphs.3-Scikit-learn: to implement machine learning models easily.Python is mostly used in real data science projects. Its versatility, community support, and available tools make it perfect to workability and effectively analyze students' data.23. Identify the type and purpose of the machine learning algorithm to be implemented for the chosen datasetClassification algorithms are used in this project to predict whether a student will pass or not based on other features. Classification is needed because the outcome ("Pass" or "Fail") is categorical.1-Main algorithm used: Logistic Regression: classifying whether a student will pass or fail given scores and background variables.We also used regression algorithms like Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression to predict continuous scores (e.g., predicting writing score from reading score).2-Why classification?Because we are classifying students into categories (Pass or Fail), not predicting precise numbers.34. Identify and Justify the independent and dependent variables for the chosen dataset.Independent Variables (the features we study):a. Genderb. Race/Ethnicityc. Parental Level of Educationd. Lunch Type (standard or free/reduced)e. Test Preparation Course (completed or none)f. Reading Scorej. Writing Scoreh. Math ScoreDependent Variable (the result we predict):a. Pass or Fail (based on the average of reading, writing, and math scores).The independent variables give us information that helps predict the dependent variable. The student's performance depends on these factors.3Total1025. Justify why you want to perform the descriptive analysis for the chosen dataset. Descriptive analysis is important because it gives a first impression of the data. It helps to answer questions like: 1-What is the mean score? 2-Do there exist students with very high or very low scores? 3-How are the scores distributed in different groups? With the help of descriptive statistics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, we can easily have an idea about the overall performance of the students. It also helps us detect any unusual patterns (outliers) at an early stage, so we can properly clean and prepare the data beforehand before building machine learning models. In short, descriptive analysis is the foundation which assist everything else we do in the project lies.11. 6. Create a script to develop a Python function for descriptive statistics. The input for the function should be the sample and the field to perform the descriptive statistics.11. 7. Create a program to random sampling of size 150 and find the descriptive statistics for the dependent variable from the sample [Apply the descriptive function which you created].11. 8. Create a script for systematic sampling by giving certain conditions and finding the desc stat for the dependent variable from the sample [Apply the descriptive function which you created].11. 9. Create a detailed descriptive statistics report about the dependent variable of the chosen dataset.11. 10. Visualize the dependent variable by the Graph/Chart of the following using Python Program:a. Scatter plotb. Box Plotc. Histogramd. Heat MapHint: Use Matplot or Ski-learn library31. 11. Perform the hypothesis test to find the correlation (Pearson and Spearman for numerical variable and chi-square test for categorical variable) between the independent variable and the dependent variable.Note: If you have more than one independent variable, then chose any one of the independent variables.11. 12. Assess the performance of the dependent variable to know whether the sample is representative of the normal population by a one-sample t-test.1Total10313. Build, Train, Develop and Evaluate using Simple Regression for chosen dataset.514.

Evaluate the performance of each model using confusion matrix and accuracy and identify the best fit classifier for the chosen dataset.917. Predict the dependent variable by using best-fit classifier.1.prepar data:- clean data and remove missing values or fill.-convert categrical variables into numerical values ( changing categorical).- scale or normalize the data.2. Pick a classifiers:-we should select different classifiers such as:-logistic regression -Desision trees-K-Nearest Neighbors(K-NN)3.split the data:-we need to split data into sets like training and testing sets-using tools like ‘train_test_split’ from libraries like ‘ scikit-learn4.train models:-we should train each classifier on the training datasets using ‘fit()’ method like : model.fit(X_train, Y_train)5.Evaluate Models:- we should test the trained models using the testing set- we 118.

Create a new repo for project in Git Hub I created a new repository on GitHub named data-analytics-project. Where I could upload and manage all the files related to CLO1, CLO2, and CLO3.Here is the link of our repo:  https://github.com/ssaara1/data-analytics-project.git. 321. Upload all the project files created for CLO1,CLO2 and CLO3 to the Git Hub repoI uploaded all the project files for CLO1, CLO2, and CLO3 to my GitHub repo by adding them to my repository, committing the changes, and then pushing them to GitHub.
